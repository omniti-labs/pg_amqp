pg_amqp

The pg_amqp package provides the ability for postgres statements to directly
publish messages to an [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) broker. Version 0.4.2 also provides an implementation 
for secured connections using open ssl. To build v0.4.2 openssl dev package is required.

All bug reports, feature requests and general questions can be directed to the Issues section on Github. - http://github.com/omniti-labs/pg_amqp


Building
--------

To build pg_amqp, just do this:

    make
    make install

If you encounter an error such as:

    "Makefile", line 8: Need an operator

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

    gmake
    gmake install

If you encounter an error such as:

    make: pg_config: Command not found

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

    env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make install

Some prepackaged Mac installs of postgres might need a little coaxing with
modern XCodes.  If you encounter an error such as:

    make: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/OSX10.8.xctoolchain/usr/bin/cc: No such file or directory

Then you'll need to link the toolchain

    sudo ln -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/OSX10.8.xctoolchain

And if you encounter an error about a missing `/usr/bin/postgres`:

    ld: file not found: /usr/bin/postgres

You might need to link in your real postgres:

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/postgres_real /usr/bin/postgres

Loading
-------

Once amqp is installed, you can add it to a database. Add this line to your
postgresql config

    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_amqp.so'

This extension requires PostgreSQL 9.1.0 or greater, so loading amqp is as simple
as connecting to a database as a super user and running 

    CREATE EXTENSION amqp;

If you've upgraded your cluster to PostgreSQL 9.1 and already had amqp
installed, you can upgrade it to a properly packaged extension with:

    CREATE EXTENSION amqp FROM unpackaged;

This is required to update to any versions >= 0.4.0.

To update to the latest version, run the following command after running "make install" again:

    ALTER EXTENSION amqp UPDATE;

Basic Usage
-----------

Insert AMQP broker information (host/port/user/pass) into the
`amqp.broker` table.

A process starts and connects to PostgreSQL and runs:

    SELECT amqp.publish(broker_id, 'amqp.direct', 'foo', 'message');

Upon process termination, all broker connections will be torn down.
If there is a need to disconnect from a specific broker, one can call:

    select amqp.disconnect(broker_id);

which will disconnect from the broker if it is connected and do nothing
if it is already disconnected.

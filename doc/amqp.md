amqp 0.3.0
==========

Usage
-----
Insert AMQP broker information (host/port/user/pass) into the
`amqp.broker` table.

A process starts and connects to PostgreSQL and runs:

    SELECT amqp.publish(broker_id, 'amqp.direct', 'foo', 'message', 1, 
			'application/json', 'some_reply_to', 'correlation_id');

The last four parameters are optional and define the message properties. The parameters
are: delivery_mode (either 1 or 2, persistent, non-persistent respectively), content_type,
reply_to and correlation_id.

Given that message parameters are optional, the function can be called without any of those in
which case no message properties are sent, as in:

    SELECT amqp.publish(broker_id, 'amqp.direct', 'foo', 'message');

Upon process termination, all broker connections will be torn down.
If there is a need to disconnect from a specific broker, one can call:

    select amqp.disconnect(broker_id);

which will disconnect from the broker if it is connected and do nothing
if it is already disconnected.
